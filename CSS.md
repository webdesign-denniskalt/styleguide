A good structure is important for your development process. You should pay attention that the base is the same in every project - it will help you and all involved persons. This is my personal structure:

```
scss/
|- _base/
|  |- _config.scss

|- _layouts/
|  |- _l-base.scss

|- _modules/

layout/
|- layout.css
```
